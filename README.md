## Getting Started - Truffle Token Contract

This requires familiarization with truffle framework and open-zeppelin for making ERC20 token contracts.

Run Compile when changes are made to the `token-contract/contracts` directory.
```
bash bin/truffle-compile
```

Run Migrate to deploy contract to node. Truffle will migrate new deployments inside `token-contract/migrations` directory but ignore those already sent.

```
bash bin/truffle-migrate
```


## Bash
There are scripts that perform operations and follow this tips to create new ones.

Create a new bash or node script 
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#!/usr/bin/env node
```
```
chmod +x ./bin/newscript
```
Add it to package.json is optional
```
  "scripts": {
    "script": "./bin/newscript"
  }
```

## Sample Contracts

Sample constracts are used for reference and can be found in `token-contract/samples`. 

- advancedToken.sol - sample token code that has been fixed to meet solidity v0.4.23. This can be tested by adding it into Mist app. Deploy using TokenERC20 token name.
